Week 1 — Getting Started
What I did
Installed VirtualBox on Windows
Created an Ubuntu Server virtual machine
Learned basic commands: ls, cd, pwd, sudo


Commands I Practiced
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx
curl localhost

What I Learned
How a VM works (it's a computer inside your computer)
Linux uses commands instead of clicking
Nginx is a web server that listens for requests

Struggles / Questions
Got confused about sudo (it means "run as admin")
Still not sure what ports are — will research next week
